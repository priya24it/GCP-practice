Certainly! Here's a rewritten version of your statement:


---

I created a reservation and assigned an Assignment ID at the project level with the following details: Reservation ID, maximum slots capacity of 50, and baseline slots set to zero.

I ran two queries:

1. The first query consumed approximately 38 GB of data and utilized 47 slots, returning the data successfully.


2. The second query consumed around 100 GB of data, but due to slot unavailability, it encountered a "query insert as slots contention" message, as shown in the attached screenshots. Despite the contention, the query returned the data after approximately 3 minutes.



Can you confirm if this is the expected behavior, considering that the data was still retrieved even though slots were unavailable in the second scenario?
